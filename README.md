## Introduction
Web application development has evolved rapidly with the growth of the internet. Modern applications are no longer monolithic systems, but instead rely on modular architectures, APIs, and cloud-based infrastructure. Alongside this evolution, web security has become a critical concern for developers.

## Web Application Development
Web applications today are commonly built using frameworks such as **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **Node.js** for the frontend and backend. These technologies enable developers to create scalable, responsive, and maintainable applications.

One popular architectural approach is **Microservices**, where applications are broken into smaller, independent services. This improves scalability and fault isolation but requires proper communication and security handling.

## Web Security
Security is a vital aspect of web application development. Common threats include:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Developers often use tools such as **JWT authentication**, **HTTPS**, and **input validation** to mitigate these risks.

## Conclusion
Understanding both web development and security is essential for building reliable applications. A secure system protects user data and increases trust, making security an integral part of modern web development.
